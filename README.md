# Hospital Management System

## Project Description

The **Hospital Management System** is a Java-based application designed to streamline hospital operations. It provides an intuitive interface for managing patients, doctors, and appointments. Leveraging object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and JDBC for database connectivity, the system ensures secure and efficient management of hospital data. Developed in IntelliJ IDEA, this project integrates seamlessly with a MySQL database for reliable data storage.
